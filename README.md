Just a simple app I am working on for motion detection on multiple webcams, and then change scene in OBS.

This repo is kinda hasty, and made just for myself, so if anything is confusion or lacks info - well now you know.

Once I am happy with the intial "finished" version, I will do a more proper write up and how to setup the cams as well so they can be used in this app and OBS at the same time.
